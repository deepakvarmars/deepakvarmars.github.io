<h3>External Hard Disk</h3>
Due to compatibility issues, it is difficult to use all formats of external HDDs in
MacOS, Windows and Linux. There are two ways to solve this issue:
<h4>Change to ExFAT</h4>
Since exFAT is the only unrestricted format that can be used on both macOS and Windows 10, it is good to change the format of an external HDD (using Disk Manager in Windows or Disk Utility in MacOS). However, this doesn't mount on Ubuntu Linux 17.10 in default settings. To access exFAT HDD in Linux, do the following:<br><br> 
sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils<br>
Disclaimer : This external HDD would work on Windows 10, MacOS 10.12.6, Ubuntu Linux 17.10<br><br>
<h4>Use NTFS format in MacOS</h4>
